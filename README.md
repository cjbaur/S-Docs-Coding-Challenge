## S-Docs Coding Challenge
Welcome to the S-Docs Coding Challenge!

Before you jump into the coding, be sure to run through the steps in the "_getting-started" directory.

    Note: The Getting Started section involves configuring a new Salesforce Trailhead org. This may involve some complicated steps, so please feel free to reach out if you get stuck!

This coding challenge is broken up into three parts:
- **Part 1**: This portion of the Coding Challenge involves building a basic structure of this coding challenge's final product.
- **Part 2**: This is the portion of the Coding Challenge where you will be given tasks to improve the product you have built in Part 1.
- **Part 3** (*optional*): This final portion of the Coding Challenge allows you to add any addition to your final product. Feel free to be creative :)!

- Test your product as you go along (feel free to log these tests and/or their results)
- Use the Salesforce documentation provided as well as the Salesforce Stack Exchange when you get stuck
